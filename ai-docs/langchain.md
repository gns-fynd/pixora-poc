Building a ReACT-Style AI Agent with LangChain (Python Developer Guide)
Overview of the ReACT Pattern

ReACT (Reasoning + Acting) is an agent prompting strategy where the AI model explicitly reasons in natural language and chooses actions (tools) in a step-by-step loop. At each step, the agent:<br>

Thought: Thinks about what to do next (in plain language reasoning)

Action: Decides on a tool to invoke (and with what input)

Observation: Receives the tool’s result and incorporates it into context

Repeat: Continues the Thought → Action → Observation cycle until ready to output an answer

.

This approach lets the model show its chain-of-thought and use tools iteratively, rather than planning everything in one go. It’s very transparent and debuggable because you can see the reasoning unfold step by step
medium.com
. The final step is outputting a Final Answer to the user once the task is complete.

Example – ReACT in action: Suppose the user asks: “Add 5+3 and then multiply the result by 2.” A ReACT agent’s interaction might look like this (with the AI’s thoughts and tool use):

Prompt to LLM: You have access to tools: [add, multiply]. Question: Add 5+3 and then multiply result by 2. Thought: (the agent prompt ends with an empty Thought for the LLM to fill in)

LLM (Thought & Action): “I need to first add 5 and 3, then multiply the result by 2.”
Action: add
Action Input: {"a": 5, "b": 3}
medium.com

Agent executes add(5,3) → Observation: 8. The agent appends this to the prompt as: Observation: 8 and continues.

LLM (Next Thought & Action): “Now I have 8. I need to multiply this by 2.”
Action: multiply
Action Input: {"a": 8, "b": 2}
medium.com

Agent executes multiply(8,2) → Observation: 16.

LLM (Final Answer): “The result of (5+3) × 2 is 16.”
medium.com

Notice how the model’s “Thought” rationales lead it to pick the right “Action” and tool input, and how each Observation is fed back into the next prompt. This is the essence of ReACT: reasoning via language and acting via tools in a loop until the goal is achieved.

Environment Setup and Project Scaffold

Before coding the agent, set up your Python environment:

Python & Virtualenv: Use a recent Python 3.x version. Create a virtual environment (using venv or Conda) for your project to manage dependencies.

Install LangChain: Install LangChain and any model-specific SDKs (e.g. OpenAI, Hugging Face) you plan to use. For example, using pip:

pip install --upgrade langchain openai pydantic 


(LangChain’s core includes support for many providers. You might also install langchain[openai] or others as needed.) The official docs provide a detailed installation guide
python.langchain.com
.

API Keys: If using cloud LLMs (like OpenAI), set up your API keys (e.g. via environment variables like OPENAI_API_KEY). Since you’re running locally (e.g. in Cursor), you can use a .env file or export environment variables so that LangChain can pick them up.

Project Structure: Organize your code with a clear entry point. For example:

your_agent_project/
  ├── main.py        # to initialize and run the agent 
  ├── tools.py       # define custom tools here 
  ├── planning.py    # (optional) code for complex planning or helper classes 
  └── requirements.txt 


Keeping tools in a separate module helps maintain clarity as your toolkit grows.

Initializing the LangChain Agent

LangChain provides high-level abstractions to create agents that follow the ReACT pattern. We will use the Chat Model API and LangChain’s agent initialization functions.

Choose an LLM: Decide on the language model powering your agent’s reasoning. For example, to use OpenAI’s GPT-4 via LangChain:

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)


You can use any supported model (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models via HuggingFace, etc.). Using a chat model with function-calling disabled (or using a raw completion model) will stick to the text-based ReACT pattern.

Define Tools: Prepare the list of tools the agent can use (we’ll cover tool definition in the next section). For now, assume we have a list tools of tool objects.

Create the Agent: LangChain (v0.2+ and v0.3) offers a convenience function create_react_agent to set up a ReACT agent. For example:

from langchain.agents import create_react_agent
agent = create_react_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools)


This returns an agent executor that will handle the ReACT loop with the given tools. Under the hood, it constructs a default ReACT prompt (including tool names/descriptions and the scratchpad for thoughts/actions) and an appropriate agent logic.

Alternatively, you can use initialize_agent with an agent type:

from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)


This achieves a similar outcome – a Zero-Shot ReACT agent that decides which tool to use based on tool descriptions.

Configure Verbosity (optional): During development, it’s useful to see the agent’s thought process. Set verbose=True when creating or running the agent to print the chain-of-thought and tool calls as they happen.

Test the Agent: In your main.py, you can now send a query to the agent:

user_query = "Make a short video about cats playing piano"
response = agent.run(user_query)  # or agent.invoke(...) depending on LangChain version
print(response)


This call will trigger the ReACT loop: the LLM will output a thought and possibly an Action to call one of your tools, the agent will execute that tool, then feed the result back to the LLM for the next step, and so on, until a final answer is produced. You should see intermediate Thought/Action/Observation logs if verbose mode is on, illustrating the reasoning process.

Defining Custom Tools

Tools are functions that the agent can use to act on the world (query data, perform calculations, generate images, etc.). In LangChain, a tool is essentially a callable plus some schema/description metadata.

1. Using the @tool decorator: The simplest way to create a tool is by writing a Python function and decorating it with @tool. This automatically wraps it into a LangChain Tool object, inferring the name, description, and I/O schema from the function’s signature and docstring
python.langchain.com
python.langchain.com
. For example:

from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply two numbers."""
    return a * b


python.langchain.com

Here, @tool does several things:

The tool name defaults to the function name (“multiply” in this case) unless overridden.

The function’s docstring is used as the tool’s description (visible to the LLM to decide when to use it).

The function’s parameters and return type define the schema for inputs and outputs. In this example, the agent will know this tool requires two integers a and b, and it returns an integer
python.langchain.com
.

You can define async tools similarly by making an async function and decorating with @tool. LangChain will handle calling it with await when appropriate
python.langchain.com
.

2. Customizing tool metadata: The @tool decorator accepts arguments to tweak the tool’s schema, if needed. For instance:

from pydantic import BaseModel

class AddInput(BaseModel):
    x: int
    y: int

@tool(name="add_numbers", args_schema=AddInput)
def add_numbers(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return x + y


Here we explicitly set the tool name and use a Pydantic model to define the input schema (which could help with validation). In most simple cases, this isn’t necessary – type hints and docstrings are enough – but it’s good to know you have this level of control. The @tool decorator can also parse Google-style docstrings to populate argument descriptions, etc., if you enable parse_docstring=True
python.langchain.com
.

3. Implementing the tool’s function: Inside the tool function, you can perform any Python logic: call external APIs, run computations, query databases, etc. Just ensure to return a string or a string-convertible result, because the agent will take your return value and incorporate it into the LLM’s next prompt. In fact, LangChain’s design expects tools to return text – if you need to return a complex object (e.g. an image or a plot), a common practice is to save it to a file and return the file path or a summary string
github.com
. This way the LLM still gets a textual observation. For example, a tool that generates an image might return a path like "output/cat.png", which the agent can describe or pass to another step.

4. Using the Tool in the agent: Once your functions are decorated, you need to provide them to the agent. Typically, you gather all tool objects in a list:

from your_project import tools  # assume this module has @tool functions which are executed on import

tools = [multiply, add_numbers, /* other tools */]
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=tools, verbose=True)


LangChain will automatically include each tool’s name and description in the prompt it gives the LLM, so the model knows what tools are available and how to invoke them.

5. Tool Input/Output Types: Thanks to type hints, the agent will pass arguments of the right type to your function. Under ReACT, the LLM typically provides tool inputs as JSON. In our example, it might produce: Action: add_numbers and Action Input: {"x": 5, "y": 3}. LangChain will parse that JSON and call add_numbers(x=5, y=3). Similarly, if your tool returns a non-string (like an int), LangChain will convert it to string when injecting into the prompt (so returning an int 8 becomes the text "8" as Observation). If you want the LLM to get a specifically formatted output from the tool (e.g. a JSON string), you should format and return it as such from your function.

6. Advanced Tool Configuration: For advanced cases, you can subclass the BaseTool class to create tools with custom behavior or state (for example, if a tool needs persistent connections or expensive initialization). This gives you fine-grained control (custom run methods, internal variables, etc.)
comet.com
comet.com
. In practice, many use-cases are covered by simple @tool functions, which are quick to write and integrate
comet.com
comet.com
. You might consider subclassing if you need to maintain complex state or want to hook into the LangChain callback system for the tool’s internals.

Prompt Template and Scratchpad (Reasoning + Acting Prompt)

Under the hood, the ReACT agent uses a prompt template that includes instructions, tool info, and a scratchpad section where the agent’s prior reasoning steps are accumulated. You typically do not have to write this prompt from scratch – create_react_agent uses a standard template – but it’s important to understand its structure, especially if you want to customize the agent’s behavior.

A generic ReACT prompt (simplified) looks like:

System: You are an assistant that can use tools. 
You have access to these tools:
- Tool1: description...
- Tool2: description...
... (each tool listed with how to invoke it)

Use the following format:
Question: {the user’s question}
Thought: {your reasoning here}
Action: {tool name}
Action Input: {tool input as JSON}
Observation: {result of tool}
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat)
Thought: {when you have the answer, no Action}
Final Answer: {the answer to the user’s question}

User: {user question here}


When the agent starts, the scratchpad (the chain of Thought, Action, Observation entries) is initially empty. After each tool call, the agent’s framework appends the new Observation and primes the prompt for the next Thought. This prompt engineering is what enables the LLM to carry on a “conversation” with itself, deciding on next actions based on past observations
medium.com
medium.com
.

LangChain’s high-level API handles maintaining this scratchpad for you. If you use agent.run(query) or agent.invoke(query), it will construct the full prompt with the latest state, call the LLM, parse its output (detecting if it’s a tool invocation or a final answer), execute tools as needed, and loop until completion.

Customizing the Prompt: If you need to alter the agent’s prompt (for example, to give it additional background knowledge or to change the formatting), LangChain allows passing a custom PromptTemplate to create_react_agent. For example:

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template_text = """Your custom instructions...
{format_instructions}  # where tool usage format is described
{knowledge_base}       # maybe some extra context you want to inject
Question: {input}
Thought: """
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template_text)
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt=prompt)


By doing this, you override the default prompt. Be cautious: the ReACT loop format is delicate. If you modify it, ensure the model is still prompted to produce Thought, Action, etc., in a recognizable way. In many cases, sticking to the default ReACT prompt (perhaps with a brief system message tweak) is sufficient, but the option for customization is there

.

Managing Agent Memory and State

In a simple QA scenario, the agent processes one query at a time. However, if you want a conversational agent or need it to remember instructions given earlier in a session, you’ll need to maintain state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.). LangChain provides Memory components to handle this context.

Conversation History: The most common state is the chat history between user and AI. For a chatty agent, you can use LangChain’s memory classes (like ConversationBufferMemory in older versions, or the new LangGraph MemorySaver checkpointing) to ensure each new user query is answered in the context of the previous dialogue.

When using create_react_agent, you can specify a checkpointer (memory store) that saves and retrieves conversation state. For example, the LangChain docs demonstrate:

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
memory = MemorySaver()
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools, checkpointer=memory)


python.langchain.com

This will automatically store each message (user question, AI thoughts, tool actions, etc.) in memory so that subsequent calls on the same session include the prior context. In effect, the agent’s prompt will carry over the previous Q&A pairs or relevant info. The MemorySaver is an in-memory checkpoint by default; LangChain can also persist to a database or file (e.g., using SqliteSaver) if you need the state to survive application restarts
python.langchain.com
python.langchain.com
.

If you prefer a simpler approach, you can manually feed conversation history to the agent by constructing the input as a list of messages (as shown in LangChain’s streaming example)
python.langchain.com
. But using a memory module is cleaner and less error-prone.

Intermediate State and Variables: Apart from chat transcripts, your agent might need to remember results it derived or data fetched earlier in the chain. Because ReACT inherently logs each Observation into the prompt, the model will recall those results in its thoughts. However, if you need to store something heavy (like a large text or an image) that shouldn’t be fully in the LLM prompt, you might keep it in a variable or external storage and only refer to it abstractly in the prompt (e.g., “I have the text of document X ready” or “Image generated and saved as image1.png”). The design decision here is to avoid prompt length inflation by large content – maybe use a summarization or embedding store if needed.

LangChain’s memory can also be used to implement long-term memory (summarizing old interactions, etc.), but that’s beyond the initial POC scope. For now, ensuring your agent either uses a memory object or you manually thread the necessary context into each call will enable multi-turn interactions and stateful behavior.

Structured Outputs and Schemas for Tools and Responses

Sometimes the agent needs to produce or consume structured data rather than free-form text. In video-generation tasks (like scene planning for a video), you might want the agent to output a JSON or object describing the plan (scenes, timings, etc.), or to call a tool with a complex input schema. LangChain supports structured outputs via Pydantic models and JSON schemas, which can be very powerful for maintaining rigour in the agent’s actions.

Structured Tool Inputs/Outputs: If a tool requires multiple parameters or nested data, the @tool decorator with type hints already helps. For example, you might have a tool create_scene(plan: ScenePlan) -> str where ScenePlan is a Pydantic model detailing characters, setting, etc. LangChain will translate the LLM’s JSON input into a ScenePlan object for you, as long as the LLM outputs a properly formatted JSON matching that schema. Using args_schema in the tool definition ensures the model knows the expected structure
github.com
.

For tool outputs, recall that the agent primarily sees text. If you want to return a structured object from a tool, the typical approach is to serialize it (e.g., return a JSON string). However, with OpenAI’s function calling or similar features, you can actually have the model directly return a JSON object. In LangChain, a Pydantic class can be treated as a function tool that yields an object. For instance, by binding a Pydantic model as a “tool” (function), the model could choose to “call” that and return a structured result natively
python.langchain.com
python.langchain.com
. This blurs the line between tools and output format – effectively using OpenAI’s function calling to get JSON back.

Structured Final Answers: LangChain provides a convenience method with_structured_output(schema) on models to enforce output structure
python.langchain.com
. You can define a schema as a Pydantic BaseModel, a TypedDict, or a JSON schema dict, and wrap your model with it. For example:

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ScenePlan(BaseModel):
    scenes: list[str] = Field(..., description="List of scenes in the video")
    duration: int = Field(..., description="Total duration in seconds")

structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(ScenePlan)
plan = structured_llm.invoke("Plan a 3-scene video about a cat and a piano")


With this, the model is instructed to output a JSON that fits the ScenePlan schema, and LangChain will parse it into a ScenePlan object automatically
python.langchain.com
python.langchain.com
. The advantage of using Pydantic is that you get validation – if the model’s output is missing a field or type-mismatched, a parsing error is raised, alerting you that the response didn’t conform.

In practice, for a ReACT agent, you might incorporate structured output in a few ways:

As a sub-tool for planning: The agent could have a tool like plan_video which itself is implemented to call an LLM with a structured output (as above) and return the structured plan (perhaps as a JSON string or object reference). The agent then uses that plan in further steps (like iterating over scenes to generate content).

Direct Final Answer formatting: If the final answer needs a specific JSON format, you might not use ReACT for that part but instead do a final validation with an output parser. Alternatively, use a function-calling agent variant for that specific task.

For your video agent POC, a reasonable approach is: Use ReACT for high-level decision-making, and when a detailed plan is required, invoke a planning tool that yields structured data. For example, an agent Thought could be “I should create a scene plan first.” → Action: plan_video (with input topic), and plan_video returns a JSON string of scenes. The agent’s next Thought can then parse or reason with that JSON (since it appears in the Observation). This keeps the ReACT loop while still leveraging structured outputs where necessary.

Parallel and Asynchronous Tool Execution

ReACT agents typically call one tool at a time in sequence (the LLM decides one action, waits for result, then decides next). However, when generating videos, you might find opportunities to parallelize work – for instance, processing multiple video clips simultaneously or generating images for different scenes concurrently.

Asynchronous Tools: LangChain’s tool definitions can be async (using async def with @tool). If your runtime and LLM support asynchronous execution, the agent can await tool calls. This is useful if a tool involves I/O (network calls, file reads) that can run concurrently with other tasks. For example, if you had to call two different APIs, you could fire them off without awaiting immediately, then gather results – though note that the basic agent loop won’t natively schedule two Actions at once; the LLM decides one action at a time. Async is more about not blocking the event loop during a call.

Parallel Plans: Another design is to have the agent plan a set of tasks and then execute them in parallel outside the LLM loop. For instance, the agent could output a plan like: “I need to generate images A, B, C for three scenes.” Your Python code could detect that plan and dispatch three image generation tool calls in parallel (using asyncio.gather or a task queue), then feed the combined results back to the agent for the next reasoning step. This requires custom orchestration on your side, as the LangChain agent by itself won’t spawn multiple tool calls from one Thought without guidance. But you can design your Supervisor code to handle this: treat the LLM’s plan output as a meta-action that your program knows how to parallelize (essentially a simple form of multi-agent or multi-task coordination).

LangChain’s newer abstractions (like LangGraph and Swarm agents) offer patterns for parallel workflows and multi-agent collaboration. For example, LangChain has demonstrated multi-agent systems where a Planner agent breaks a job into sub-tasks and multiple Worker agents execute them concurrently
blog.langchain.com
blog.langchain.com
. In the context of your video agent: you could have a planner agent that outputs a list of scene tasks, and a pool of worker agents or tools that generate those scenes in parallel. This is an advanced pattern and might be overkill for a POC, but it’s good to keep in mind for scaling (we’ll touch more on scaling in the next section).

In summary, for parallelism in a POC:

Use async tools if any tool call can be awaited (e.g. non-blocking external API calls).

If a single user request involves many independent steps (e.g. generating 10 images), consider writing your agent such that it produces a list of tasks, and then handle the execution of those tasks concurrently at the Python level.

Ensure thread-safety or avoid shared state issues if you do run tasks in parallel threads/processes. Some libraries (like certain AI model libraries) may not like being called from multiple threads at once.

Example: Video Generation Agent Flow

Let’s walk through a hypothetical video generation agent that ties everything together. It has tools for several video-related tasks: scraping a video from a URL, generating captions, generating an image, animating an image, merging clips, etc. We’ll focus on how a user prompt flows through reasoning and tool calls:

User Prompt: “Create a 5-second video of a cat playing a piano. Add a funny caption.”

Agent Reasoning and Actions:

Thought: “The user wants a short video of a cat at a piano with a caption. I should break this into tasks: find an image or video of a cat at a piano, animate it if needed, overlay a caption.”
Action: search_video (a custom tool to search for videos or images)
Action Input: {"query": "cat playing piano image"}
(Agent executes the search_video tool, which perhaps uses an API or local data to find a relevant short clip or image.)
Observation: "search_video returns a URL or filepath of a cat image cat_piano.jpg.”

Thought: “I have an image of a cat at a piano. To make it a video, I need to animate it.”
Action: animate_image
Action Input: {"image_path": "cat_piano.jpg", "duration": 5}
(Agent runs the tool which generates a 5-second video clip from the image, e.g., using some animation or panning effect.)
Observation: "animate_image returns cat_piano_clip.mp4.”

Thought: “Now I should add the funny caption text as an overlay.”
Action: caption_video
Action Input: {"video_path": "cat_piano_clip.mp4", "caption_text": "I play by ear."}
(Tool opens the video, renders the caption text on it.)
Observation: "caption_video returns final_video.mp4.”

Thought: “The video is ready.”
Final Answer: “Here’s your video: final_video.mp4 – A cat playing piano with the caption.”

(In a real implementation, the final answer might be a URL or a note that the video file has been saved locally.)

This chain shows the agent planning and invoking multiple tools in sequence. In practice, some of these steps could be combined or parallelized (e.g. if multiple images/clips were needed, it might fetch/generate them in parallel). The structured planning could come into play if, for example, the user asked for a more complex video (multiple scenes): the agent might use a plan_video tool to outline scenes first, then loop through generation for each scene. Each scene generation could even be a sub-agent or done concurrently.

The scratchpad for this multi-step exchange would include each Thought/Action/Observation, which is invaluable for debugging. If something goes wrong (e.g., a tool returns an error or the AI chooses an irrelevant tool), you can inspect these steps to understand why.

Throughout development, frequently test your agent with different prompts. Use verbose logging or LangChain’s callback system to capture the reasoning traces. This helps ensure the agent is choosing tools wisely and following the expected format.

Best Practices and Scaling Up Beyond a POC

Building a ReACT agent is an iterative process. Once you have a working prototype in Cursor, consider the following best practices to make it robust and ready for scale:

Thorough Testing: Try diverse queries, including edge cases, to see how the agent behaves. Does it get stuck in loops? Does it ever hallucinate tools that don’t exist? LangChain’s tracing or callback logging can record sequences for analysis. Write unit tests for critical tool functions (especially those with side effects).

Tool Design Principles: Each tool should be idempotent and side-effect-free as much as possible (aside from intended effects like creating files). This makes the agent’s behavior more predictable. Incorporate some error handling in tools and consider what the tool should return if something fails (perhaps a clear error message that the LLM can read and decide how to handle).

Model Considerations: If using OpenAI models, leverage function calling for tools where appropriate. If your agent sometimes outputs structured data as the final answer, you might even switch to a create_structured_chat_agent for that part. Evaluate model options – GPT-4 is powerful but expensive; maybe some tasks can be offloaded to cheaper models or local models if needed (LangChain supports model routing, if you get to that complexity).

Memory Management: As conversations or tasks get longer, ensure you have a strategy for memory. For example, use a windowed memory (keep only the last N interactions) or a summary memory (summarize old parts) to avoid exceeding context length. LangChain can help automate these strategies (see ConversationSummaryMemory, etc.).

Concurrency and Scaling: If the agent will be used in a high-throughput setting or needs to handle multiple user sessions, consider running it in a web service with concurrent workers. Each session could maintain its own agent (with its memory). Use task queues or async patterns for any long-running steps (like video rendering). The architecture described in LangChain’s LangGraph (with a Supervisor coordinating multiple agents) is one way to scale out complex workflows
blog.langchain.com
blog.langchain.com
. Even if you don’t adopt LangGraph, the principle of dividing responsibilities is useful: e.g., have a high-level agent that plans (could even be a separate planning function or agent), and low-level functions that execute (the tools). This separation can make the system more modular and easier to extend.

Structured Logging and Monitoring: As you scale beyond POC, integrate logging for each agent run. Log the prompt, decisions, tool outputs, and final answer. This will be invaluable for debugging issues in production. LangChain’s LangSmith or other observability tools can help capture and visualize agent traces.

Iterative Refinement: Be prepared to refine the prompt or add tool constraints if the agent makes mistakes. You might, for example, add an instruction in the system prompt like “If you don’t know how to proceed, output a Final Answer saying you can’t do it” to prevent infinite loops. Or use an “Allowed Tools” reminder in the prompt to keep it focused.

Security and Safety: Since your agent can execute code/tools, be mindful of what inputs you pass to those tools (especially if any tool executes shell commands or calls external APIs). Validate or sanitize tool inputs if they come directly from the LLM and could be risky.

Beyond POC – Advanced Architecture: As seen in projects like Jockey (Conversational Video Agent), complex applications often use a multi-agent system: a Supervisor agent routes requests, a Planner agent breaks down tasks, and specialized Worker agents or tools handle subtasks like video search, text generation, or editing
blog.langchain.com
blog.langchain.com
. This kind of architecture can handle very complex workflows and parallel tasks, and is something to aspire to if your project grows. Initially, a single-agent ReACT loop might do everything, but as you add features, watch out for the agent prompt becoming too unwieldy (too many tools, too many responsibilities). That’s a sign you may want to split logic into multiple coordinated agents.

Performance Optimization: Video generation can be slow. Profile where the time goes – if a particular tool (like animate_image or merge_clips) is slow, see if that can be optimized or run offline. You can also cache results of tools (e.g., if the same image generation is requested twice) to save time, using memoization or LangChain’s caching utilities.

Finally, keep up with LangChain’s updates. As of 2025, the ecosystem is evolving (e.g., LangGraph, improved agent APIs, etc.). New features like better parallelism support or more intuitive tool integration are being released. Always check the docs or community examples for patterns that could simplify your implementation.

With these guidelines, you should have a solid foundation for building your ReACT-style AI agent in Python. By structuring your code well, leveraging LangChain’s abstractions, and carefully planning your agent’s reasoning and tools, you can create a powerful video generation agent (or any multi-tool agent) that is maintainable and scalable beyond the prototype. Good luck, and happy coding!
